# Sioyek

This is my sioyek config files for MacOS (only some path changes and keybinds).
Super fast search and vim keybindings!
I have different branches for different OS.

## Keybinds to remember
- ```m<a-z>``` or ```m<A-Z>``` to mark a location (not the same as bookmark).
- ``` `<a-z>``` opens any marks binded to letter only in the current file.
- ``` `<A-Z>``` opens any persistent marks binded to a capital letter globally.
- ``` `<S-t>``` opens saved Tutorial.pdf from my permanent bookmarks.
- `g<C-S-L>` goes to the top right of the current page to go to the next column.
